Data and Problem Details
Objective : You have to build a data model to predict the probability of default, and choose a cut-off based on what you feel is suitable. Alternatively you can also use a modelling technique which gives binary output.
You have to do the following:
Based on the data that is available during loan application, build a model to predict default in the future. This will help the company in deciding whether or not to pass the loan.
Also note that the data contains defaulters, successful payers and customers who were current during that time. To simplify the problem, customers under 'current' status have been considered as non-defaulters in the dataset.
You will be provided with:
-	Dataset containing both train and test data
-	Data dictionary

Steps to be followed (tentative time required):
1) Understand the problem and objective (1 hour)
2) Understand the data and develop some business sense. (4-5 hours)
3) EDA, segmentation (if you think is required in this case). (5-6 Hours)
4) Data Cleaning (4-5 Hours)
5) Feature engineering (4-5 Hours)
6) Model Building (try various techniques and at the end justify why you chose a particular technique over others) (3-4 hours)
7) Testing and Cross-validation (3-4 hours)
8) Final results, recommendations and plots/visualizations. (4-5 hours)
9) Any other insights or recommendations that you can give from the data which will help the business. (subjective)
